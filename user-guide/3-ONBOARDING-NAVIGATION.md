## üéØ Start Here: Complete Beginner Setup

### What You Need

## üì± Step 1: Get a Wallet (MetaMask)

### What is a Wallet?
A **digital wallet** is like a bank account for cryptocurrency. It's free software that:
- Stores your digital money (but on testnet, it's fake money)
- Lets you interact with blockchain websites
- Gives you a unique address (like an email address for crypto)

### Install MetaMask
1. **Go to**: [metamask.io](https://metamask.io)
2. **Click**: "Download" for your browser
3. **Install**: Browser extension 
4. **Create account**: Follow the setup wizard
5. **IMPORTANT**: Write down your seed phrase on paper and store safely

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical**: Your seed phrase is like a master password. Never share it with anyone!

## üåê Step 2: Visit Our Website & Click üöÄ

### Getting to the Onboarding
1. **Go to**: Our club website
2. **Look for**: üöÄ rocket ship emoji on homepage
3. **Click it**: Opens the guided setup modal

### What Happens Next
You'll see a **3-step process**:
- **Step 1**: Add Network (Polygon Amoy)
- **Step 2**: Get Test Tokens (free POL)
- **Step 3**: Mint Membership (get your NFT)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Add Polygon Amoy Network

### Why This Network?
- **Polygon Amoy** is a test network (testnet)
- **Everything is free** - no real money involved
- **Perfect for learning** without financial risk

### Automatic Setup (Recommended)
1. **Click**: "Add Polygon Amoy" button in the modal
2. **MetaMask will pop up**: Click "Approve" to add network
3. **Done!** Network added automatically

### Manual Setup (If Button Fails)
If the automatic button doesn't work:

1. **Open MetaMask**
2. **Click**: Network dropdown (top of extension)
3. **Click**: "Add Network"
4. **Enter these details**:
   - **Network Name**: Polygon Amoy Testnet
   - **RPC URL**: https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology/
   - **Chain ID**: 80002
   - **Currency Symbol**: POL
   - **Block Explorer**: https://amoy.polygonscan.com/

### Alternative
- **Visit**: [Polygon Portal](https://portal.polygon.technology/)
- **Click**: "Switch to Testnet" button
- **Follow prompts**: To add Amoy network

## ü™ô Step 4: Get Free Test Tokens (POL)

### What are POL Tokens?
- **POL** = Polygon's native token
- **Gas fees** = Small amounts needed for transactions
- **Provided by club** = Officers distribute from club resources
- **Like tokens for arcade games** = Needed to use the blockchain

### Getting POL Tokens
1. **Click**: "Request POL Tokens" button in modal
2. **Submit request**: This creates a request for officers to review
3. **Wait for approval**: Officers manually process requests (usually within a few hours)
4. **Receive POL**: Officers send tokens directly to your wallet
5. **Check MetaMask**: You should see POL balance after processing

### How It Actually Works
- **Not an automatic faucet** - Officers manually review and approve each request
- **Request system** - Your wallet address gets added to a queue for review
- **Manual distribution** - Officers send POL tokens directly from club resources
- **Usually processed within a few hours** during regular club hours

### Troubleshooting
- **Request failed?** Try again in 5 minutes (rate limited)
- **Still no tokens after 24 hours?** Ask officers at meetings or via email
- **Wrong network?** Make sure MetaMask shows "Polygon Amoy"
- **Already requested?** You can only have one pending request at a time

---

## üé´ Step 5: Request Whitelist Approval

### What is the Whitelist?
- **Security measure** to verify you're a real student
- **Officers review** each request manually
- **Usually approved within 24-48 hours**
- **One-time process** per person

### How to Request
1. **Click**: "Request Whitelist" button
2. **Transaction pops up**: Confirm in MetaMask
3. **Wait for approval**: Officers will process your request
4. **Get notified**: Via email when approved

---

## üé® Step 6: Mint Your Membership NFT

### After Whitelist Approval
1. **Go to**: Gallery page (`/gallery`)
2. **Find**: Governance section
3. **Choose**: Your preferred membership token style
4. **Click**: "Mint" button
5. **Confirm**: Transaction in MetaMask

### What You Get
- **Digital membership card** (NFT)
- **Voting rights** in club governance
- **Access to member features**
- **Permanent record** of membership

## üÜò Getting Help

### If Something Goes Wrong
1. **Check network**: Make sure you're on Polygon Amoy
2. **Check POL balance**: Need small amount for transactions
3. **Try refreshing page**: Sometimes fixes connection issues
4. **Contact officers**: Email or ask at meetings

### Common Issues
- **Transaction failed**: Usually means insufficient POL
- **Wrong network**: Switch to Polygon Amoy in MetaMask
- **Whitelist pending**: Be patient, officers review manually
- **NFT not showing**: May take a few minutes to appear

### Support Contacts
- **Email**: [Officers' email from docs]
